# CCSS Python Workshop Series

## General instructions for all parts

There are two officially supported ways to access the workshop tutorial code:

1. Online access via Binder **(Preferred method)**: Each workshop in the series has its own associated Binder link, which can be used to access the material online in your web browser - no setup needed! Scroll down to find the links for each of the 4 workshops in the series. Note that if you use this method, any changes you make (for example, writing down answers to exercises) will not be saved, and will go away once you close your browser. If you want to keep you changes, you can use the "Download" button inside each notebook to download a copy to your computer.
2. Local access: You can also download the workshop materials to your own computer and run the code offline. To do this, first clone this GitHub repository to your computer, and make sure you have Jupyter installed on your computer. Then, scroll down to find specific instructions for each workshop in the series.
